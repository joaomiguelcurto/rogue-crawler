# rogue-crawler

This project is inspired by [Rogue](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1443430/Rogue/) (on steam) it was the very origin or roguelike games with a minimalist style, all art consists of ASCII characters. The only problem is that the game has not been updated ever since, i love the old style and nostalgia for games like this. My objective for this project is to "recreate" Rogue with my own style in terms of funcionalities, RNG possibilities, and hopefully, with the tecnology we have today compared to back then make a more complete game that other people can enjoy for free and anywhere (it runs on any terminal).
